## Usage
To generate the RSS feed with the top HN comments containing URLs, run the following command:

```

Optional arguments:

- `--depth DEPTH`: Depth of comments to read on each post (default: 5)

You can then use an RSS reader to subscribe to the generated feed and discover interesting content shared in the comments on Hacker News.
